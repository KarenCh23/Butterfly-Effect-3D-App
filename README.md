## ✨ About the project

**Butterfly Effect** is an immersive landing page built as a conceptual showcase for a **mental health & self-care application**.

The experience blends **scroll-based narration**, **animated 3D butterflies**, and **cinematic transitions** to convey the idea that *small actions can create meaningful change* — just like the butterfly effect.

The project focuses heavily on:
- smooth user experience
- visual storytelling
- performance optimization
- mobile responsiveness
